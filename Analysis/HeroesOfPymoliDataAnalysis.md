## Opportunities to Increase Profit Margins

 Similarly, players in the age group 35-39 spend about 16% more on item purchases than the average player. Nostalgia items that are designed for this portion of the player base should have a price premium attached to them.

## Future Analysis
A whopping 50% of items that underwent a price change ranked in the top 10 best selling items. We do not have information on the reasoning for the price change, or the sequence of prices. It is recommended that information be collected on date of purchase and price changes for use in future analysis.
