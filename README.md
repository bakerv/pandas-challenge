# Pandas-Challenge

This data analysis challenge leverages the power of the pandas library to produce dataframes that are easy and efficient to work with. The .groupby(), .agg(), and .cut() functions are used extensively to sort through the data and return information to guide future sales. The python script is written using jupyter notebooks for the ease of executing sequential operations on the data, and the convienience of viewing the dataframes as you work.

### Data Set
The Heroes of Pymoli data set was used for this challenge. This is a relatively small data set that emulates micro transaction data for video game purchases. The identifying characteristics for players are age, gender, and screen name. The identifying sales characteristics are item name/ID and sale price.

### Analysis Summary
* The next advertising campaign should be targeted towards males ages 15-29.
* Female players, and players in their late 30's, are willing to pay more for items. Price premiums should be applied to items tailored for these audiences.
* Data should be collected on transaction date and price changes. Future analysis with this data can be used to develop marketing strategies.
