# Pandas-Challenge

This data analysis challenge leverages the power of the pandas library to produce dataframes that are easy and efficient to work with. The .groupby(), .agg(), and .cut() functions are used extensively to sort through the data set and return information to guide future sales. The python script is written using jupyter notebooks for the ease of executing sequential operations on the data, and the convienience of viewing the dataframes as you work.
